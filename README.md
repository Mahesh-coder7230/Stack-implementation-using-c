# Stack-implementation-using-c
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.  ✅ Key Stack Operations: Push – Adds an element to the top of the stack.  Pop – Removes the top element from the stack.  Display – Shows all elements currently in the stack
